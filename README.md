# LuSE Stock Price Display Web App

## Project Overview

The **LuSE Stock Price Display Web App** is designed to provide users with real-time and daily updated stock prices from the **Lusaka Securities Exchange (LuSE)**. This application empowers investors and traders to:

- **Monitor Stock Prices**: Access up-to-date information on various stocks listed on the LuSE.
- **Analyze Trends**: Utilize interactive charts to visualize stock price trends over time.
- **Access Historical Data**: View historical stock prices to identify patterns for better investment decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate easily through a clean and intuitive layout.

By integrating real-time data and dynamic visualizations, this web app aims to facilitate informed investment strategies in the Zambian stock market.

## Project Goals

This project is public, meaning anyone can contribute and help improve the application. Contributions can range from code enhancements and feature additions to documentation improvements. If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request!

## Technologies Used

The application will be built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: To create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture allows for easy management of UI state and interactivity.
  - **Chart.js**: For rendering interactive charts to visualize stock trends.
  - **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the web app, ensuring a visually appealing user experience.

- **Backend** (optional):
  - **Node.js**: To create a server-side application that can handle API requests and serve data.
  - **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js, used to build the backend API for fetching stock data.

- **Database** (optional):
  - **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**: For storing historical stock data if needed. MongoDB will allow for flexible schema design, while PostgreSQL provides robust relational capabilities.

- **API Integration**:
  - **Axios**: To make API calls for fetching real-time stock data from the LuSE API or other financial data providers.

## Project Progress

As of now, the project has made significant progress in the following areas:
- **Initial Setup**: The frontend environment has been set up with React, and the basic structure of the app is in place.
- **API Integration**: Initial API calls have been established to fetch stock prices successfully.
- **Chart Implementation**: Basic charts are implemented using Chart.js to visualize stock price trends.

## Challenges Encountered

During the development process, several challenges have been encountered:

1. **API Limitations**: Accessing real-time data can be limited by API restrictions. To overcome this, we are exploring multiple data sources to ensure reliable and timely updates.
   
2. **Data Visualization**: Presenting data effectively in a user-friendly manner was challenging. We addressed this by iterating on the chart design and utilizing Chart.js features for enhanced interactivity.

3. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the app works seamlessly across different devices was another challenge. We tackled this by using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
